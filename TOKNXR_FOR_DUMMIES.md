Replace your AI API base URL:
```javascript
// Before
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  // your request
});

// After  
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8788/openai/v1/chat/completions', {
  // your request
});
```

### For Command Line Tools
```bash
# Before
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent
